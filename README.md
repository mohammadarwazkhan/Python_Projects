Election Data Analysis
Data:
1. UP_2022.csv : this file contains the results of the election to the UP assembly held in the
year of 2022.
2. UP_AC_District: this file contains the assembly constituency to district mapping. It will
have ac_no to district mapping.
Understanding Elections
● Every state in India has a government body called the Assembly or the Vidhan Sabha.
Elections are held every five years.
● A state is divided into geographical areas called constituencies. Uttar Pradesh has a
total of 403 such constituencies.
In every constituency there will be a number of candidates that contest the election. Most
candidates are from a political party. Some also contest independently (i.e without any
affiliation to a political party)
● An example below shows a snapshot of the data (UP_2022.csv) showing the election
results in ac_no 1. Ac_no stands for assembly constituency number. It ranges from 1 till
403.
● Whichever candidate gets the most number of votes in that constituency is the winner
from that constituency. So in the above data, Umar Ali Khan from the Samajwadi Party
was the winner from ac_no 1.
● There will be a total of 403 winning candidates.
